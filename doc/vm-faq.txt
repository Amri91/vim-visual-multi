                                                             *vm-faq-functions*
How can I do something before VM starts, or after VM ends? ~

You can create these functions: >
  function! VM_Start()
  function! VM_Exit()
<
                                                                 *vm-faq-remap*
How can I remap x in VM? ~

There are two ways: either do a remap using the functions above, e.g.:  >
  function! VM_Start()
    nmap <buffer> <C-C> <Esc>
    imap <buffer> <C-C> <Esc>
  endfunction

  function! VM_Exit()
    nunmap <buffer> <C-C>
    iunmap <buffer> <C-C>
  endfunction
<
or use |g:VM_custom_remaps| (normal mode only), e.g.:  >
  let g:VM_custom_remaps = {'<c-p>': '[', '<c-s>': 'q'}
<
This will preserve the function of the original mapping. If you want to replace
it entirely, see |g:VM_maps|.

                                                             *vm-faq-find-char*
How can I select a single character and search it? ~

<C-n> generally can't do this because non-word characters are often included in
some bigger pattern. You can add a mapping like this:
>
  nmap gl \\\<Tab>\\r
<
assuming you use default leader. That would be: add a cursor, switch mode and
add a search pattern. Similarly, you can create mappings like:
>
  nmap cp vip\\c
<
This would create a column of cursors that spans the current inner paragraph.
